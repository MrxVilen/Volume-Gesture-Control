# Volume Control Using Hand Gestures

In this project, I've used openCV which is an Open Source Computer Vision Library and Mediapipe which is a cross-platform pipeline framework to build custom machine learning solutions for live and streaming media and developed by Google.



# Features 
1) Can track hand movements in real-time.
2) Can change your system's volume based on your hand movement.
